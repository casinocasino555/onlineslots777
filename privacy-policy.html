            <h3>Advertising, analytics, automatically collected information and use of cookies and other tracking technologies</h3>

            <p>Advertising. We employ third party ad serving technologies, such as IronSource and UnityAds, that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. These third parties may collect and use data, for such purposes, including but not limited to, data such as IP address, Device ID (persistent/non-persistent), MAC address, installed software, application usage data, hardware type, OS information, browser information, in-game information, IMEI and your device name. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the third party providing the ad serving technology. If you wish to “opt out” of targeted advertising, you may do so from the settings of our game. Please note that if you choose to “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you. In addition, you may see our mobile games advertised in other services. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our mobile game, you will become a user of our Service. In order to verify the installs, we may have to share a device identifier with the advertiser. For more information, please see our full partner list here.
            </p>

            <p>Analytics. We use your information to enable analytics provided by third parties such as DeltaDNA, UnityAnalytics and Appsflyer. We use analytical information for supporting business analysis and operations, business intelligence, product development, improving products and services, personalizing content, providing advertising, and making recommendations. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal data you submit within our Services. For more information, please see our full partner list here.</p>

            <p>Automatically collected information and cookies. In addition, as you nav­i­gate through and in­ter­act with our Ser­vices, we may au­to­mat­i­cally col­lect cer­tain in­for­ma­tion about your equip­ment, brows­ing ac­tions and pat­terns, in­clud­ing:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>details of your visits to our Services, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Services;</li>
              <li>information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, language, operating system and browser type and referring web site addresses may be logged automatically;</li>

            </ul>
            <p>The in­for­ma­tion we col­lect au­to­mat­i­cally is sta­tis­ti­cal data, and does not iden­tify any in­di­vid­ual. This in­for­ma­tion is use­ful to us for trou­bleshoot­ing and helps us un­der­stand usage trends. It helps us to im­prove our Ser­vices and to de­liver a bet­ter and more per­son­al­ized ser­vice by en­abling us to:</p>

            <p>Your personal information may be disclosed to third parties including third parties located outside the EU/EEA in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy. We may use third parties to collect and process personal information on our behalf and in according to our instructions. Nevertheless, we are not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.</p>

            <p>We may disclose to the following categories of third parties the personal information which you provide yourself to the Service or which we collect in the Service:</p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Service providers, such as data storage service providers, which enable us to provide the Service to you;</li>
              <li>Our advertising and analytics partners which may process your personal data for the purposes described herein and where applicable, working as joint controllers of the processed data together with us. A list of these partners is available here;</li>
              <li>Public authorities, such as law enforcement, if we are legally required to so or if we need to protect our rights or the rights of third parties; and</li>
              <li>Our subsidiaries and affiliates; or a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Moreover, we may disclose information to third parties in an aggregate format that does not constitute personal information and does not allow identification of individual users.</p>

            <h3>How do we protect your personal data and how long do we store them?</h3>

            <p>Only those of our employees, who on behalf of their work are entitled to process customer data, are entitled to use a system containing personal information. Each user has a personal username and password to the system. The information is collected into databases that are protected by firewalls, passwords and other technical measures. The databases and the backup copies of them are in locked premises and can be accessed only by certain pre-designated persons.</p>

            <p>We store the personal information for as long as is necessary considering the purpose of the processing. Additionally, we retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <p>We regularly assess the need for data retention in light of the applicable legislation periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data. In addition, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the personal information in the register is not incompatible, obsolete or inaccurate considering the purpose of the processing. We rectify or delete such information without delay.</p>


            <h3>What are your rights as a data subject?</h3>


            <p>You have the following rights as a data subject:</p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the section 1 of this Privacy Policy.</li>
              <li>In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the section 1 of this Privacy Policy</li>
              <li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.</li>
              <li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
              <li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Special Note About Children’s Privacy</h3>

          <h5>Child directed sections of the service</h5>

          <p>Although our Services are intended to a general audience, we may from time-to-time have special sections intended, in part, for children. For the sake of clarity, those sections in the Services are not targeted to children under 13 years of age as a primary audience. We also do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age within such sections, except as may be permitted by COPPA. In order to protect the children’s privacy, we have implemented age screen mechanism in accordance with COPPA which treats users based on their self-reported age. Accordingly, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for building user profiles are not available to users under 13 years of age. We also do not allow our third-party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.</p>

          <p>We and our third-party partners however do collect non-personally identifiable information from users under 13 years of age. Such a non-personally identifiable information is strictly limited to persistent identifiers (such as a customer number held in a cookie, IP address, device serial number, or a unique device identifier) which are used for sole purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Services. Such internal operations include, without limitation activities necessary for the Services to maintain or analyze its functioning, authenticate users or personalize content and to serve contextual advertising or cap the frequency of advertising as permitted by COPPA. We also ensure that persistent identifiers are not used or disclosed to contact a specific individual or for any other purpose.</p>

          <p>Nevertheless, please note that our third-party partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes. While we require that our third-party partners comply with this privacy policy before we allow them to access our Services, we do not actually control their data collection practices and use. We highly encourage users and parents to review the list of third-party partners below and to become familiar with those policies and practices.</p>


          <h5>Sections of the services which are directed to general audience</h5>

          <p>In accordance with the foregoing, majority of our Services are directed to general audience. These sections are not intended to children under 13 years of age, therefore no one under 13 years of age may not use those sections or provide any personal information within those sections of the Services. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or direct or target behaviorally targeted advertising to anyone under 13 years of age or knowingly allow such persons to use these sections of the Services.  If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself to us while using these sections of the Services, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  No one under 13 years of age may provide any personal information.</p>

          <p>In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at support@Addictive Gamers.com.</p>

          <p>If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under 13 years of age, we will dispose of that information, or otherwise treat it in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under 13 years of age has provided us with personal information, please contact us at  support@Addictive Gamers.com.</p>

          <p>If you have additional questions about our data collection practices related to children under the age of 13, please contact us at support@Addictive Gamers.com.</p>

          <p>Should we make amendments to this privacy policy we will place the amended statement on our Website, with an indication of the amendment date. If the amendments are significant, we may also inform you about this by other means, for example by sending an email or placing a bulletin on our homepage. We recommend that you regularly visit out webpage and notice possible amendments to this privacy policy.
